# My Portfolio

## About Me

Economist oriented toward the modelling and deployment of BI/Data Science processes that would lead to the implementation of data-driven operations within an organization.

Ability to use high-level scripting language (Python) and data query language (SQL or similar) on a daily basis. I seek to obtain answers and identify key trends by analyzing data and building econometric and machine learning models. Likewise, I apply these skills in the improvement of internal processes in my current job. 

Constantly involved in a self-development and learning process through formation and consistency.

## Projects

[**Building an Analytical Scouting Model based on Algorithms and Advanced Metrics**](/projects/streamlit-scouting/project.md)

<img src="images/streamlit.jpg?raw=true"/>

The purpose of this project is to develop a model that, when deployed on an app, will segment players in the world’s most important football competitions according to advanced metrics. By taking into account the game model of teams, the model will link each club to the type of player who, given their position on the field, best fits into their game model. The value of the model lies in adding the team’s style of play - both their own and that of their opponents - as a key factor, measuring and quantifying it to identify those players who are closest, based on advanced metrics, to the numbers of the team being analyzed.

[**Celta de Vigo 2022 - The Playmaker Dilemma. A Data-Driven Approach**](/projects/celta/project.md)

<img src="images/celta.jpg?raw=true"/>

We will carry out the task of looking for a profile that could fit into the role of organizer that Denis Suarez, out of the club plans due to disagreements with the board, has been assuming in recent years, mainly since the arrival of Argentine Eduardo Coudet on the bench. The goal of this project will be, then, to obtain a shortlist of similar players to Denis Suárez, employing techniques such as clustering and having in account the concept of euclidean distance.
