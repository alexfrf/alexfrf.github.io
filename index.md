## About Me

Economist oriented toward the modelling and deployment of BI/Data Science processes that would lead to the implementation of data-driven operations within an organization.

Ability to use high-level scripting language (Python) and data query language (SQL or similar) on a daily basis. I seek to obtain answers and identify key trends by analyzing data and building econometric and machine learning models. Likewise, I apply these skills in the improvement of internal processes in my current job. 

Constantly involved in a self-development and learning process through formation and consistency.

## Projects

[**Segmentation & Profiling of Football Players through Clustering, Advanced Metrics and Analysis of Game Model**](/projects/streamlit-scouting/project.md)

<img src="images/streamlit.png?raw=true"/>

The purpose of this text is to describe the project for the planning, development, conceptualization and subsequent deployment of a web application that visualizes a model that seeks to segment the characteristics of the players in the most important world football competitions according to advanced metrics and, segmenting the game model of the teams, being able to associate, to each club, the footballers who, for each position on the field, best fit into their system. The purpose is to add the variant of the team's style of play -their own and the others-, measuring and quantifying it to be able to find those players that are closest, based on advanced metrics, to the numbers of the team that we are analyzing. Those footballers will be the ones that, potentially, best suit the needs for which said team goes to the market, since they will be pieces that will require a shorter adaptation process and will know similar game mechanisms, since they will come from sets that, tactically, show similarities.

[**Celta de Vigo 2022 - The Playmaker Dilemma. A Data-Driven Approach**](/projects/celta/project.md)

<img src="images/celta.jpg?raw=true"/>

We will carry out the task of looking for a profile that could fit into the role of organizer that Denis Suarez, out of the club plans due to disagreements with the board, has been assuming in recent years, mainly since the arrival of Argentine Eduardo Coudet on the bench. The goal of this project will be, then, to obtain a shortlist of similar players to Denis Suárez, employing techniques such as clustering and having in account the concept of euclidean distance.
