## About Me

Economist oriented toward the modelling and deployment of BI/Data Science processes that would lead to the implementation of data-driven operations within an organization.

Ability to use high-level scripting language (Python) and data query language (SQL or similar) on a daily basis. I seek to obtain answers and identify key trends by analyzing data and building econometric and machine learning models. Likewise, I apply these skills in the improvement of internal processes in my current job. 

Constantly involved in a self-development and learning process through formation and consistency.
